Vorab, weil in der Vorlesung gesagt wurde, dass nen 30 seitiges Paper zu lesen genau so schnell gehen sollte, wie in 10 seitiges Paper versuche ich hier einmal das vorgehen von einem [Guide](https://papersowl.com/blog/how-to-read-a-research-paper).

## Introduction
Usage of WCS (Web-conferencing Systems (Software like Zoom and Teams)) has increased while, it is still seen as a second tier communication option due to more points of failure but also people started using the software privatly. 

This Paper tries to look at, how people use WCS during covid, what role it played during covid and in what direction the software should be continued to be developed. Also Adding a Twitter Communication Analysis about those systems over the Course of the Pandemic.

Also Focus on affordance shifts due to the WCS.


## Research Method
Document the use of WCS that emerged during the Covid crisis. Data Driven. Using Twitter to get insight on Covid Experiences of Institutions, Organisations and Private Individuals. By Scraping Twitter with its Api for tweets with content like (Zoom,MSTeams etc.) and later cleaning them up.

## Findings

### Affordances
- WCS used to catch up with private contacts
- Meet and Socialize online
- Attending Events, concerts
- Hobbies online yoga classes


### Problems
- Hard to setup
- Fear on being on camera
- Zoom fatigue
- Security and Privacy issues (Zoom being unsecure)

Look at the results yourself, It has many graphs and might be a better indepth view.

Paper 1:
People use different tools for Different Occasions. The Research focuses a great efford on how people socialize using Zoom and other WCS but from personal experiences I know these Software tools are designed for work. So I can imagine People also tending to use different Software like Discord or Xbox Live to organize social interactions (especially the younger generation). Would the exclusion of such WCS let changes in affordance look more drastic than they should?
