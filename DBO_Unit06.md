# Introduction
## Situation
- Covid came up
- stress on health system
- requirements for social distancing
- knowledge workers had to work from home
## Remote work before Covid
- optional
- to avoid distractions
- marginalized
- social professional isolation
- missed informal learning opportunities
- not always from home /
- not only remote

## Remote work during Covid
- every day from home
- no power distance
- new technology
- new uses of existing technology
- communication only via technology

Because covid is the first pandemic with our technological advancement, there was no research conducted on the affordance of the field.

## Points of interests
- how do the workers adapt
- how to keep "business as usual"
- how do the workers solve problems in that regard
- how does the work environment / behavior / social impact change

## Methods
- affordance theory
  - behaviors with IT Objects
  - what are the work spaces?
- unrecognized roles of technology
  - inventive uses of technology


# Literature review

## Pre COVID-19 situation for remote working:
- Pros:
  - less (office) distractions
  - increased autonomy
  - less work-home conflicts

- Cons:
  - blur between work and live -> difficult switch due to blurred boundaries
  - more distractions from home (depends on home situation)
  - emotionally demanding (less social interactions)

## Situation during COVID-19:
- Not much empirical research at that time

- additional cons:
  - ill prepared for only remote Working
  - restricted mobility (contrast to autonomy in pre-COVID)

- also see table 1

## Affordances and team collaboration
- Affordances are possibilities (for animals) in their environment
- additional technical affordances for humans
- technical affordances divided into functional and Social
- functional:
  - relation between user and technology
  - possibilities for every individual (due to a technical object)
- social:
  - people to people relation
  - possibilities a person can provide another one

- different affordances from same technical object possible (depends on intention)
- team collaboration adapts technology, that doesn't need to be designed for their needs
- teams usually need sufficient training


# Research Method

## Data collection
- 29 interviews
- recruitment over social media
- 11 Apr 2020 - 26 Apr 2020
- interview of Author to see biases
- Has Table of Demographics
- [table with demographical information on p. 433]


Surveys Asked about:
- how they complete their tasks
- collaborate with their peers and superiors
- interact with their clients
- opinion of participants
  - regards of collaboration
  - how to solve problems with technology

## Data analysis
- thematic analysis
- creating initial codes
- reviewing themes
- theory of affordance to look at patterns (?)
- switch between logic and data to answer our initial questions (?)

# Findings

## circumstances
- Forced remote work
- More stress due to covid
- shared rooms with others from the house
- less Physical activity
- missing social contact, toll on workers mental

## Affordance
- loss of environmental affordances
  - people didn't meet other people in rooms / buildings
- Technological Affordances
  - online communication
  - workers can proceed their work and coordinate
- Functional affordances
  - behaviors offered by technology
    - visibility
    - edit ability
  - remained the same
- Social affordances
  - increased
  - enabler for team collaboration
  - increased role conflict

## The change in ad-hoc conversation and the impact on team communication and knowledge sharing
- Less spontaneous social interactions (informal information exchange)
- conversations are more purpose driven
  - increases efficiency
  - more tasks are completed
  - you need a topic to call
  - less disruptions
- less spontaneous meetings makes it harder to coordinate and knowledge sharing
  - less shoulder taps
  - cannot distinguish between busy and not busy
  - sending too many messages makes things awkward

Learning and knowledge sharing is important for the teams success. But the new environment create barriers for learning and problem solving.

## Virtual meetings as a double-edged sword for team collaboration
pros:
- regular formal meetings
- improved communication
- more thoughtful communication of topics
- established morning routines
- more agile allocation of tasks

cons:
- virtual meeting fatigue
  - when clashing with private schedule
- now the need to schedule meetings to communicate
- isolation and no personal contact for one group
- no quiet environment and surrounded by people for the other
  - children are at home as well
  - not everybody has his own home office

## Socializing and networking through virtual channels
No more company gatherings and going to bars
- more international communication and networking
- new connections independent of business structures
- more equal integration of all workers
- one big group discussion instead of many small groups
- more involvement of social media / more personal
- less urgency

# Discussion and conclusion
Before Covid: Technological affordance was mostly supportive
- finishing tasks
- connecting to remote workers

Environmental affordance was main facilitator. During covid the affordance shifted. Less environmental affordance and more technological affordance.

more opportunities for homeworkers as well as between team members and leaders for communication. Less isolation for home workers.

Communication styles had to be adjusted to be technological only. You cannot just ask your colleague something quick during the meeting.
- No simultaneous talking
- no mingling from group to group
- checking meetings are too often

Affordance environment and technology are pre covid complementary, now conflicting.
- home needs to be compromised for work
- home environment tanks productivity
- does not support social interaction
- no physical activities
- shared with other people
- dynamic schedules/ more autonomy

affect well being of workers and productivity

## Theoretical contributions
contribution to affordance theory, by understanding of substitution.
- increased perception and actualization due to withdrawal of workplace environmental affordance
- transferable in context of mobilities and crisis situations, when affordance changes

Understanding of remote work and team collaboration, during lockdowns
- merging of work and living spaces -> (re)negotiation and (re)arrangement of workers, working patterns and work life balance
- functionalities of technologies during lockdown and leading behavior changes and communication patterns.
  - new possibilities
  - old systems don't work anymore
- new ways of productivity
- more equality of opportunities for remote workers

Working from home without preparation
- better understanding of other literature
- adaption / negotiation / struggles of knowledge workers
- puts remote working in context of enforced and non voluntarily

## Managerial implications
- reevaluate pace and patterns of working
- domestic and wellbeing should be considered while allocating tasks and planning communication
- change processes to keep advantages which were gained during covid
  - higher productivity
  - reduced communication barriers
  - integrated remote e-workers
- How to harvest benefits of workplace affordance and home affordance

## Limitations
- narrow demographics
- different lockdown restrictions of participants

## Avenues of future research
- new world-wide working arrangement?
- see table 4
