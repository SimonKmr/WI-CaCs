# Identifying affordances

1. Affordances arise from user/artifact relation, not just artifact
2. Maintain distinction between affordance and ctualization
3. Focus on cation, not state condition reached after taking action
4. Selecting appropiate levels of granularity for the affordances
5. Identify all salient affordances and how they interact
5. Recognize sozial forces that affect affordance actualization


Communicate via smartphone:
= Affordance, not just it's profuct
- What the smartphone offers and the users -> is used
here: lower level of granularity -> very gerneral
here high affordance
higher level of granularity -> very specific
sending pictures to mom -> sublevel of communicating with mom

--> Affordances interact with each other

Affordance only exists, when you do not have the connection (like the phone number)

Do you think that with the choice of partly working at home, that this has a macroeconomic value/

With your criticism, do you argue that the sample esp the low amount of interviews is not representative?
