#Too Drained from Being Agile? The Self-Regulatory Effectsof Agile ISD Practices Use and their Consequences for Turnover Intention

## Introduction

- information systems development (ISD)
- respond quickly to changing conditions
- adoption rate increases in many business areas
- demands on developers -> short cycle times and permanent responsiveness to change + constant pressure to deliver software increments

- consequence to stay or leave a company (!)
- developer churn, enormous costs
- prev: more focus on org. implementation
- lead to ineffective decision making, likely to produce stress
- requires a high level of self-discipline to overcome communication barriers
-different direct and indirect effects on job satisfaction
- important determinants of job satisfaction

**Research Questions:**

1. Does the use of agile ISD practices have resource-enhancing and -depleting effects? If so, how do these effects influence developers’ turnover intentions?
2. How does developers’ perceived workload affect the resource-enhancing and -depleting effects of agile ISD practices use?

- quantitative and qualitative data collected and interpreted
- field survey to analyze the impact of work-related fatigue
- investigated how developers’ perceived workload shaped the effects
- collected quantative data + conducted interviews with developers
- they extend our knowledge on developers’ psychological conditions

## Theoretical Background

### Agile software development and project management practices 

- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- working product over comprehensive documentation”
- “customer collaboration over contract negotiation”
- “responding to change over following a plan”

Agile SD Practices:
- Agile SD practices focus on more IS artifact-centric tasks that primarily guide the execution of the software development process
- developers use dedicated test code to (automatically) test the effects of changes to the system
- established norms and conventions for code naming and consitency
- continuous integration and refactoring

Agile PM Practices:

- people-centered tasks
- focus on facilitating the performance
Scrum:
- became particularly popular concentrating on project management
- creative team work
- solving complex problems
- preferably held face-to-face
	- eg daily standups, project progress and current tasks are discussed
	- retrospectives refelects on last iteration and identifies improvement


### Related literature on the effects of agile ISD practices use

- consequences studied on 
	- organizational, 
	-project, 
	-team, and
	- individual level
- elf-managed team of developers
- empowerment has been found to be motivating for developers
-increased
communication requirements 
- intensive
knowledge sharing
- developers have to invest
more time and effort into these communication
activities
- conflicts among developers
who may disagree in terms of code structure and
quality
- = double-edged sword
- agile PM approach is able to prevent exhausting phases
by balancing the workload in ISD projects
- agile ISD
practices in general can simultaneously impair and
improve developer well-being.
	- study also lacks a
distinction between types of agile practices necessary
to achieve a deeper understanding and make effects
visible on a more granular level

### Self-regulation and feelings of fatigue

- resisting distractions or coping with stress are
demands that require a great deal of control over
oneself
- describes a state of diminished availability of
regulatory resources or self-control strength
- compares self-control strength with muscle exhausted when continuously exerted
-muscle gets energized, so that one experiences less
feelings of fatigue (?)
- environment that is
autonomy supportive instead of controlling can help to
build regulatory resources
- EDT has the potential to provide
a solid foundation for investigating potentially positive
and negative effects

## Hypotheses development

- Fig. 1: feelings
of fatigue and turnover intentions
- mediator in the
relationship between agile SD and PM practices use
and developers’ turnover intentions

![Fig 1](~/F1-Unit-10-reading.png)

### Agile SD practices and self-regulatory
resources

- process of programming and
implementing software
aim for smoothening processes,
enhancing understanding, facilitating collaboration,
and reducing the level of frictions lowering stress,
cognitive demands, and negative feelings among
developers.

- They argue: less likely
to feel fatigued due to lower consumption of self-
regulation
- feedback in agile systems is given by failed unit and acceptance
tests as well as continuous integration actions on a
server
- automated
feedback likely to lead to a seamless and undisturbed
workflow
- testing feedback on small pieces of code -> generate more positive feelings
- higher quality of
the system
- enhances code clarity and
simplicity
- cognitive processing of code of other programmers bbecomes easier
- coding standards allow for a certain degree of
behavioral automation
-create a comfortable
atmosphere through motivation and positive feelings
- use of agile SD lowering their feelings of
fatigue in their work

### Agile PM practices and self-
regulatory resources
- devs report 
	- constant time pressur
	- exposed to many interruptions from their
development work
- daily
demands requires discipline
- authors argue: PM practices are likely to trigger resource-
depleting effects
- short cycles lead to pressure on developers to
frequently deliver software increments
- constant push to perform
- exhausting meetings
 constant planning needed
 
### The mediating role of work-related
feelings of fatigue

- job turnover has been suggested to be
the first thing most employees consider
- positive effects of work-related fatigue on turnover
intention for IT professionals
- stressful work leads to employee turnover via work-
related fatigue
- --> need to build up pisitive feelings

stressful work leads to employee turnover via work-
related fatigue

H2a: Feelings of fatigue mediate the negative effect of
agile SD practices use on developer turnover
intention such that agile SD practices use reduces
turnover intentions because they negatively affect
feelings of fatigue.

- daily development and collaboration activities
are draining their self-regulatory resources


H2b: Feelings of fatigue mediate the positive effect of
agile PM practices use on developer turnover
intention such that agile PM practices use
increases turnover intentions because they
positively affect feelings of fatigue

### The role of perceived workload in
agile ISD

- Higher
workload considered mainly in two
ways:
	- one individual becomes part of various projects
including more frequent switching between tasks
	- projects get more intense in the sense that
more tasks need to be accomplished in the same
amount of time

- Higher workload, in general, is likely to produce
feelings of stress and require attentional focus and
higher cognitive processing
- varying
effects on developers’ level of fatigue

They argue:

- practices
have energizing effects on software developers
- propose that the unique characteristics of
agile SD practices unfold their full potential in high
workload situations, when time pressure is high or
switching between projects becomes prevalent,
reinforcing the enhancement of developers’ self-
regulatory resources.
- benefit to a higher degree from the use of agile
SD practices -> if workload is high

- eg: automated
tests and clear coding standards exhibit their
automation advantages -> cope with additional
development tasks is likely to increase only slightly.
- trigger positive feelings after ccomplishing higher number of tasks in same amount of time
- beneficially leverage the respective
practices in in high workload situations

---

H3: Perceived workload negatively moderates the
relationship between agile SD practices use and
developers’ feelings of fatigue such that when
perceived workload is high (vs. low) developers
experience less feelings of fatigue from agile SD
practices use.

- higher level of workload likely
implies a higher drain of regulatory resources due to
more disruptions and substantial time pressure
- various meetings provide feedback and improve work practices


H4: Perceived workload positively moderates the
relationship between agile PM practices use and
developers’ feelings of fatigue such that when
perceived workload is high (vs. low) developers
experience more feelings of fatigue from agile PM
practices use.

## Research Approach

- two
independent studies
- two studies with
different methods and samples allowed for
triangulation of our findings

![Fig2](/Fig2-Unit-10.png)

## Quantitative field survey study

### Sample and data collection

- online survey
- conducted
among ISD professionals in the United States
- screening questions, wether they work with agile methods
- answer questions concerning feeling of
fatigue in the context of agile ISD projects.
- included a
number of control variables in the prediction


### Data analysis and results

- lean sample sizes
- performed a cross-loading analysis

- potential threat of common method
bias
- conducted a full collinearity test

- results show a significant negative
effect of agile SD practices use on fatigue
- we found significant
interaction effects of agile SD practices use and
perceived workload and of agile PM
practices use and perceived workload
- more developers
perceive their workload as high, the stronger and more
negative is the effect on their levels of fatigue
- contrast, agile SD practices has no significant effect on

- fatigue when developers perceive their workload as
low
- developers’ levels of fatigue at high and low levels of
perceived workload

- use of agile PM
practices is significant and strongly positively related
to developers’ levels of fatigue, when developers
experience higher levels of workload
- 38% of variance in turnover intention
- e introduced the mediator
feelings of fatigue -> variance in turnover intention increased to 41%
- effect of
agile SD practices use on feelings of fatigue is negative
and significant

- The direct effect of agile SD practices on
turnover intention remains insignificant

-The direct effect of agile SD practices on
turnover intention remains insignificant

- Control variable negative affect has a
significant effect on turnover intention
- turnover intention the index of
moderated mediation is positive and significant

- elationship between agile SD
practices and turnover intention is negative and
marginally significant
-> ndicating a
stronger negative indirect effect of agile SD practices
use on turnover intention through feelings of fatigue
when perceived workload increases
- interaction with perceived workload entail significant
implications of developers’ feelings of fatigue

## Qualitative interview study

- Semi-structured interviews
- 15 interviews in Germany
were conducted face-to-face or via phone and lasted
between 30 and 60 minutes
- no additional insight
- asked the developers about their attitude and feelings
towards the different agile PM and SD practices under
regular and high workload

- three knowledgeable researchers
read the transcripts and marked each sentence that
referred to feelings
- relief of
daily work routine through automation in the following quotes

### Findings

#### Relationship between agile SD practices
use and feelings of fatigue

- testing is annoying
- fast feedback 
- quality enhancements
- higher
speed of development later on because code snippets
become modular and reusable
- code consistency they provide clear and objective
guidelines for developers -> understandable for every existing or new team
member
- critic: refactoring = time consuming
- problem: working software is appreciated, not neat code
- automation and continous feedback -> may reduce workflow interruption
- high quality and consistency of the code
facilitates the cognitive processing of information and
lowers the number of conflicts in the team


#### Relationship between agile PM
practices use and feelings of fatigue


- facilitate collaboration but
at the same time cause distractions
- daily standups, just endure them
- get annoyed being forced to
evaluate the team dynamics and processes
continuously
-- negative emotions in meetings that do not
provide developers with any benefit are actions that
require self-regulation
- appreciated the constant information flow and
easy communication
- iteration planning
meetings as sources of information to be helpful for
their daily work.
- good
feeling and common understanding among developers
-build a
positive atmosphere and help to strengthen the team
cohesion
- sense of achievement
and self-efficacy because developers see frequently
what they have accomplished
-- positive impact on developers’
levels
- ego problems with feedback


#### Relationship between agile SD and PM
practices use and feelings of fatigue
during high perceived workload

- automation of tasks during the process of
programming and the clear guidance provided by
coding standards
- keep up with
the higher number of tasks when workload is high and
that product quality can be maintained
- refactored code enhances
quality and consistency, developers do not engage in
this task when workload is high because in these
situations delivering working code is more important
to the customer in these situations,
- developers
appreciate the ability to exploit the efficiency
- displeasure -> difficulties completing their programming tasks even
though in times of high workload frequent results are
expected
- 
-high personal effort to
maintain concentration
- invest a lot of self-
control to stick to the agile PM
-time pressure inherent in phases of
higher workload was reported to reduce discipline
- indicate
intensified negative feelings towards these
- we observed that
agile SD practices enhance and agile PM practices
deplete self-regulatory resources of developers

#### Integration of Qualitative and
Quantitative Study Results

- depletion or enhancement of
self-regulatory resources
- 

## Discussion

- more balanced view on the
individual-level effects of agile ISD practices
- important: attitude towards current work
- potential to build a shared understanding and
circumvent conflicts through mutually agreed targets
- significant positive
interaction between agile PM practices use and
developers’ perceived workload, such that at high
workload, developers experience increased depletion
and fatigue
- higher workload also leads
to an amplified positive effect of agile PM practices
use on developers’ turnover intentions through higher
feelings of fatigue
- exhibit a levelled effect during normal
workload and a resource-depleting effect when
workload is perceived as high
- higher speed of development and
facilitated communication on one side and frustration
and displeasure on the other


### Theroetical Contributions

- more balanced and comprehensive view on
the implications by litrature
- effect of enhancing shared
understanding yet requiring self-control
- important counterpoint to a potential positivity bias
in previous research on the consequences of agile ISD
practices use
- From them: detailed insights from our qualitative
study on resource-enhancing and resource-
depleting effects of agile ISD practices
- shed light on the psychological
processes underlying the effects of agile ISD practices
use on feelings of fatigue
- interview results added another perspective to the
discussion on the psychological impact
- Agile SD practices lead
to lower fatigue through higher automation, better
product quality, and an enhanced feeling of certainty
when coding
- resource-enhancing effect of constant
feedback and shared understanding on one side, and
the depleting effect of needless meetings and little
progress on the other, seem to cancel each other out
- Only when workload is perceived as high, the
resource-depleting effects prevail such that fatigue is
significantly affected by agile PM practices use
- workload
intensifies the effect of both agile SD and agile PM
practices on feelings of fatigue and, ultimately,
turnover intention
- perceived workload as an important individual-level
moderator
- boost both a resource-replenishing and
resource-depleting effect in developers
- important boundary
condition and differentiator between specific types of
agile ISD practices
- work-based
implications of ego depletion
- first step towards showing that they also hold
and even potentiate in situations of high perceived
workload
- 

### Practical Contributions

- scarce resource and their
turnover is costly
- potential of fatigue and turnover intention
- make agile ISD projects more
sustainable
- sensitize developers and
project managers particularly to the resource-depleting
implications of agile PM practices
- seek help
and support specifically in high workload situations
- carefully consider whether certain agile PM practices
can be suspended or reduced for some time based on
the stage of the project in order to free up valuable time
for coding
- re-evaluate the frequency of
daily standups and retrospectives as well as the agile
SD practice of refactoring because these are often
perceived as particularly disruptive and annoying
when workload is high
- recommend
that organizations adopt suitable tools and procedures
that can increase automation,

- agile ISD
practices have psychological implications – positive
and negative – for developers’ well-being
- mplementing agile SD methods
throughout software development functions and give
agile ISD teams the autonomy to decide on the best
way to do their work
- effects of agile ISD do not only spill over to activities at work
outside of agile projects but also to family life
- findings may support organizations in strengthening
their position in the competition for high potentials
- 


### Limitations and Future Resarch

- four major limitations
1. used feelings of fatigue as a
measure for the resource-depleting effects of agile ISD
practices application
	- did not include an
explicit construct to survey resource-enhancing effects
	- assume that a
reduction of fatigue leads to an enhancement of
developers’ regulatory resources

2. theorized and modelled ego depletion as
being expressed by enhanced levels of fatigue
	- particularly suitable proxy because the depletion of
regulatory resources resembles the process of tiring a
muscle
	- depletion does not only occur
concurrent to the triggering action but leads to a period
of scarcity until the resources are built up again
	- future studies might measure ego
depletion using items going beyond those of fatigue,
exhaustion, and burnout

3. recognize the potential risk caused by
considering only the four most used practices of agile
SD and PM methods and by the use of shortened scales
for our latent variables
	- survey length short -> reach as many complete and valid answers as possible
	- more comprehensive list of practices used
in future studies
	- 
 	
4. examined consequences of agile ISD
practices application on an individual level only
	- invite future research to consider multiple
levels when studying agile ISD practices
	- generate further
insights on boundaries of a resource-enhancing or
resource-depleting effect
	- taking individual-level ego
depletion into account
	- dyadic
studies and compare the implications of agile ISD
practices use from different stakeholder perspectives

- balanced
perspective when examining implications
- 





# Conclusion

- energizing (i.e., resource-
enhancing) impact on individual developers’
regulatory resources, 
- hence, decrease their level of
fatigue and their turnover intentions, while agile PM
practices use depletes developers’ regulatory
resources, -> enhancing their level of fatigue and
intentions to change jobs.
-hypotheses in our model. Agile SD
practices use lowers turnover intentions through the
mediating effect of fatigue
- depletion effect only during
phases of high workload.
- importance of considering individual
developers’ perceived workload when evaluating their
effectiveness
- PM practices use
has neither an energizing nor a depleting effect on
developers.


## Comments / Questions

Regarding the interviews: What about the problem that people tend not to tell the truth or subconsciously deny feeling stressed? Doesn't this lead to inaccuracies, because how stressed the people wasn't observed objectively (eg. by sensors)?

In my feeling, the authors focused too much on the turnover intentions created by this style of programming, but not really on the positive aspects (other side of the medal). From our own experience, it is more depending on the circumstances - the team and how agile approaches are carried out. Do you agree with this?

Comment: The study itself looked more like being biased from the beginning. It looks to me, like they only wanted to look at negative aspects and found positive ones on the side. Despite, the paper itself looked been written sloppy to me (Formatting is not consistent, tables are not on one page, title on each page with: "Your Short Title Goes Here: 50 Characters or Less").This would even be embarrassing for me with a student paper, but at an official publication?
