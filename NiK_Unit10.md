#Too Drained from Being Agile? The Self-Regulatory Effectsof Agile ISD Practices Use and their Consequences for Turnover Intention

## Introduction

- information systems development (ISD)
- respond quickly to changing conditions
- adoption rate increases in many business areas
- demands on developers -> short cycle times and permanent responsiveness to change + constant pressure to deliver software increments

- consequence to stay or leave a company (!)
- developer churn, enormous costs
- prev: more focus on org. implementation
- lead to ineffective decision making, likely to produce stress
- requires a high level of self-discipline to overcome communication barriers
-different direct and indirect effects on job satisfaction
- important determinants of job satisfaction

**Research Questions:**

1. Does the use of agile ISD practices have resource-enhancing and -depleting effects? If so, how do these effects influence developers’ turnover intentions?
2. How does developers’ perceived workload affect the resource-enhancing and -depleting effects of agile ISD practices use?

- quantitative and qualitative data collected and interpreted
- field survey to analyze the impact of work-related fatigue
- investigated how developers’ perceived workload shaped the effects
- collected quantative data + conducted interviews with developers
- they extend our knowledge on developers’ psychological conditions

## Theoretical Background

### Agile software development and project management practices 

- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- working product over comprehensive documentation”
- “customer collaboration over contract negotiation”
- “responding to change over following a plan”

Agile SD Practices:
- Agile SD practices focus on more IS artifact-centric tasks that primarily guide the execution of the software development process
- developers use dedicated test code to (automatically) test the effects of changes to the system
- established norms and conventions for code naming and consitency
- continuous integration and refactoring

Agile PM Practices:

- people-centered tasks
- focus on facilitating the performance
Scrum:
- became particularly popular concentrating on project management
- creative team work
- solving complex problems
- preferably held face-to-face
	- eg daily standups, project progress and current tasks are discussed
	- retrospectives refelects on last iteration and identifies improvement


### Related literature on the effects of agile ISD practices use

- consequences studied on 
	- organizational, 
	-project, 
	-team, and
	- individual level
- elf-managed team of developers
- empowerment has been found to be motivating for developers
-increased
communication requirements 
- intensive
knowledge sharing
- developers have to invest
more time and effort into these communication
activities
- conflicts among developers
who may disagree in terms of code structure and
quality
- = double-edged sword
- agile PM approach is able to prevent exhausting phases
by balancing the workload in ISD projects
- agile ISD
practices in general can simultaneously impair and
improve developer well-being.
	- study also lacks a
distinction between types of agile practices necessary
to achieve a deeper understanding and make effects
visible on a more granular level

### Self-regulation and feelings of fatigue

- resisting distractions or coping with stress are
demands that require a great deal of control over
oneself
- describes a state of diminished availability of
regulatory resources or self-control strength
- compares self-control strength with muscle exhausted when continuously exerted
-muscle gets energized, so that one experiences less
feelings of fatigue (?)
- environment that is
autonomy supportive instead of controlling can help to
build regulatory resources
- EDT has the potential to provide
a solid foundation for investigating potentially positive
and negative effects

## Hypotheses development

- Fig. 1: feelings
of fatigue and turnover intentions
- mediator in the
relationship between agile SD and PM practices use
and developers’ turnover intentions

### Agile SD practices and self-regulatory
resources

- process of programming and
implementing software
aim for smoothening processes,
enhancing understanding, facilitating collaboration,
and reducing the level of frictions lowering stress,
cognitive demands, and negative feelings among
developers.

- They argue: less likely
to feel fatigued due to lower consumption of self-
regulation
- feedback in agile systems is given by failed unit and acceptance
tests as well as continuous integration actions on a
server
- automated
feedback likely to lead to a seamless and undisturbed
workflow
- testing feedback on small pieces of code -> generate more positive feelings
- higher quality of
the system
- enhances code clarity and
simplicity
- cognitive processing of code of other programmers bbecomes easier
- coding standards allow for a certain degree of
behavioral automation
-create a comfortable
atmosphere through motivation and positive feelings
- use of agile SD lowering their feelings of
fatigue in their work

### Agile PM practices and self-
regulatory resources
- devs report 
	- constant time pressur
	- exposed to many interruptions from their
development work
- daily
demands requires discipline
- authors argue: PM practices are likely to trigger resource-
depleting effects
- short cycles lead to pressure on developers to
frequently deliver software increments
- constant push to perform
- exhausting meetings
 constant planning needed
 
### The mediating role of work-related
feelings of fatigue

- job turnover has been suggested to be
the first thing most employees consider
- positive effects of work-related fatigue on turnover
intention for IT professionals
- stressful work leads to employee turnover via work-
related fatigue
- --> need to build up pisitive feelings

stressful work leads to employee turnover via work-
related fatigue

H2a: Feelings of fatigue mediate the negative effect of
agile SD practices use on developer turnover
intention such that agile SD practices use reduces
turnover intentions because they negatively affect
feelings of fatigue.

- daily development and collaboration activities
are draining their self-regulatory resources


H2b: Feelings of fatigue mediate the positive effect of
agile PM practices use on developer turnover
intention such that agile PM practices use
increases turnover intentions because they
positively affect feelings of fatigue

### The role of perceived workload in
agile ISD

- Higher
workload considered mainly in two
ways:
	- one individual becomes part of various projects
including more frequent switching between tasks
	- projects get more intense in the sense that
more tasks need to be accomplished in the same
amount of time

- Higher workload, in general, is likely to produce
feelings of stress and require attentional focus and
higher cognitive processing
- varying
effects on developers’ level of fatigue

They argue:

- practices
have energizing effects on software developers
- propose that the unique characteristics of
agile SD practices unfold their full potential in high
workload situations, when time pressure is high or
switching between projects becomes prevalent,
reinforcing the enhancement of developers’ self-
regulatory resources.
- benefit to a higher degree from the use of agile
SD practices



















In my feeling, the authors focused too mmuch on the turnover intentions created by this style of programming, but not really on the positive aspects (other side of the medal). From our own experience, it is more depending on the circumstances - the team and how agile approaches are carried out. Do you agree with this?
