#Contradictory Influence of Social Media Affordances on Online Communal Knowledge Sharing
 
##Introduction

- knwoledge -> important resource to be shared broadly throghout 
- CMC = Computer mediated communication -> referred as social media
- capabilites also in blogging, wikis, rss feeds, social tagging etc
- Eg IBM uses social networking tools for knowledge sharing (side note: They also developed their own application for companies, which is called IBM Lotus Notes)
- sharing kowledge as a collective good (not in text, but avoids the issue of knowledge loss in companies, when someone leaves)
- referred as **knowledge-sharing engagement**
- Paper question: *How could knowledgesharing engagement in the workplace be changed with the use of social media?*


## An Affordance Lens

- role of social media on knowledge sharing process
- potential of technology
- affordance perspective
- build on thesis of 4 affordances of social media usage (by Trem and Leonardi)

## From Online Knowledge Sharing to Online Communal Knowledge Conversations

- historically, knowledge sharing handled by subgroups
- now centralized process organized from mangers
- Social media llows knowlege sharing from centralized to decentralized
- centralized to decentralized as shift from online knwoledge sharing to continous online communal knowledge conversations
- "dance" between knowing and knowledge
- online posts = conversations since/to indicate their dynamic decentralization and emergent nature
- asyncronous communication (chats and co)
- workers, which did not knew each othr can meet up and fix minor issues
- communication is unpredicatable

- 4 affordances: 
	- metavoicing
	- triggered attending
	- network-informed associating
	- generative role-taking


## Metavoicing

- Affordance of meta-voicing = ongoing knowledge conversationn by reacting online to others presence, profiles content and activites

## Generative Role-Taking

## Discussion

## Implications and Future Research

## Conclusion

Q1: Currently one of our group members is participating in an international project, where the group members are from different universities. Collaborating became sometimes difficult, since there is a 9 hour difference in time zones. There, miscommunication was faced because some things were misunderstood. The absence of other parts of communication like the tone in the voice of the speaker, mimic, gestics etc. could be a reason for these (in our opinion).
Do you think, that asynchronous communication is a good idea for knowledge sharing, especially when you work in teams? How do you think that the previous stated conflicts can be reduced (which can occur in asynchronous communication)?
