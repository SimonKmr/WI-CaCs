#Contradictory Influence of Social Media Affordances on Online Communal Knowledge Sharing
 
##Introduction

- knwoledge -> important resource to be shared broadly throghout 
- CMC = Computer mediated communication -> referred as social media
- capabilites also in blogging, wikis, rss feeds, social tagging etc
- Eg IBM uses social networking tools for knowledge sharing (side note: They also developed their own application for companies, which is called IBM Lotus Notes)
- sharing kowledge as a collective good (not in text, but avoids the issue of knowledge loss in companies, when someone leaves)
- referred as **knowledge-sharing engagement**
- Paper question: *How could knowledgesharing engagement in the workplace be changed with the use of social media?*


## An Affordance Lens

- role of social media on knowledge sharing process
- potential of technology
- affordance perspective
- build on thesis of 4 affordances of social media usage (by Trem and Leonardi)

## From Online Knowledge Sharing to Online Communal Knowledge Conversations

- historically, knowledge sharing handled by subgroups
- now centralized process organized from mangers
- Social media llows knowlege sharing from centralized to decentralized
- centralized to decentralized as shift from online knwoledge sharing to continous online communal knowledge conversations
- "dance" between knowing and knowledge
- online posts = conversations since/to indicate their dynamic decentralization and emergent nature
- asyncronous communication (chats and co)
- workers, which did not knew each othr can meet up and fix minor issues
- communication is unpredicatable

- 4 affordances: 
	- metavoicing
	- triggered attending
	- network-informed associating
	- generative role-taking


## Metavoicing

- Affordance of meta-voicing = ongoing knowledge conversationn by reacting online to others presence, profiles content and activites
- adding metaknowledge to opinion
- Metavoicing-> possible through various technology capabilities
- forms: retweeting, voting posts (up- or down), commenting etc
- helpful for decisions (see above forms, but also tagging)
- rapid feedback
- critical mass theory:
	- sufficient number of people (= critical mass)
	- attend to common event, attention will drive more people to the common event in a [brandwagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect) effect. 
	- brandwagon effecht = tendency for people to adopt certain behaviors, styles, or attitudes simply because others are doing so
	- creates much feedback (highlighting strengths, weaknesses, perceived value from original content)
	- can help to steer indiviuals in a firm
	- engagement in knowledge exchange

**Contrary effect: Groupthink**

- not wise
- when most choose one direction, mistakeenly assume this is a representative example
- actually reepresent a not representable part of the group


This means:
Metavoicing provides a way where workers can engage in knowledge conversations
can foster productive knowledge conversations while having the critical mass effect
Simulataneously: can inhibit productivity when promoting biased and inaccurate information


## 2. Triggered Attending

= engaging in online knowledge converation by remaining uninvolved in content production
= timely automated informs of changing of specific content (not in text, eg Confluence by Atlassian)

previously/Past:
- personally monitor interisting parts to share knowledge

- now: automated though social media (Wiki, Chats, Twitter)
- notification, when someone wants to watch changes 
- eg: Customer twitters about food-> registered by social media team _> company arranges free meal for compensation
- triggered attending can also lead to negative effects:
	- fail to activate important mechanisms
	- decreasing effort to engage
	- results in limited dialogue
	- might reduce opportunity to explore for more knowledge 

- basing knowledge on pre-defined triggers -> difficulty to understand other's perspective
- if individuals use alterts to check on employees (micromanagement) -> causes employees to withdraw from conversations + people beeing more cautious of what they share

Summary:
- affordance triggered attending provides to engage in knowledge conversations in workplace
- can foster productive knowledge conversations
- otivates people to engage because of minimal effort
- (-) triggered attending can inhibit productivity of these communications (no contextualization, not seeing the big picture, trust is harmed)

## 3. Network-Informed Associating

= engaging in online knowledge conversation **informed by relational and content ties**
- with technology, users are able to see with whom other people are connected with
- not only personal connections
- capability to make new connections easily (eg join a team)
- also for facebook-like social networks within companies
- increases social capital (esp. weak ties)
- negative consequences: the rich get richter: only connect with popular people
- blind finding
- 

## Generative Role-Taking

- enacting actions and taking on community sustaining roles in order to **maintain a productive dialogue among participants**
- visibility of dialogues (-)
- complicated to work around arguments and fights among workers, when there are no roles assigned
- (+) assign team leaders (generative role taking base)
- can evolve in routines
- easy to add new functionalites to social media
- quickly introduce and force new routines
- 

Summary:
- foster productive knowledge coversation thogh reflecively reframing conversations to remove (temporarily) barriers that emerged a conversation
- can inhibit productivity when organizational memory is lost

## Discussion

- affordances have contradictory effect (simulaniously hindering and helping)
- probably also applicable outside of companies
- tensions (among aims and the 4 knowledge sharing parts) are not always negative
- - identifies which individuals can exert control over knowledge

## Implications and Future Research

- implications in terms of professional reputation, connection strategies, build up of social capital and imagine manegement
- individuals are able to populate influential roles and rengage in highly visible exchanges
- open question: How ar individuals able to find a balance of comunication and work
- when is it too many
- social media affordances challenge traditional conceptualizations of knowledge management
- 

## Conclusion

- explore collaborative knowledge sharing
- theorize social media prodives 4 affordances
. differen theoretical mechanisms
- some move forward, others have unintended consequences

##QUestion
Q1: Currently one of our group members is participating in an international project, where the group members are from different universities. Collaborating became sometimes difficult, since there is a 9 hour difference in time zones. There, miscommunication was faced because some things were misunderstood. The absence of other parts of communication like the tone in the voice of the speaker, mimic, gestics etc. could be a reason for these (in our opinion).
Do you think, that asynchronous communication is a good idea for knowledge sharing, especially when you work in teams? How do you think that the previous stated conflicts can be reduced (which can occur in asynchronous communication)?
