- no powerdistance
- new technology
- new uses of existing technology

Because covid is the first pandemic with our technological advancement, there was no research conducted on the afforandce of the field.

## Points of interests
- how do the workers adapt
- how to keep "business as usual"

- how does the work enviorment / behaviour / social impact change

- interact with their clients
- opinion of participants
  - regards of colaboration
  - how to solve problems with technology

## Data analysis
- thematic analysis
- creating initial codes
- reviewing themes

- switch between logic and data to answer our init questions (?)

# Findings

# Discussion and conclusion
## circumstances
- More stress due to covid
- shared rooms with others from the house
- less Physical activity
- missing social contact, toll on workers mental

## 
- loss of environmental affordances
  - people didnt meet other ppl in rooms / buildings
- Technological Affordances
  - online communication
  - workers can proceed their work and coordinate
- Functional affordances
  - behaviours offerd by technology
    - visibility
    - ediitability 
  - remained the same
- Social affordances
  - increased
  - enabler for team collaboration
  - increased role conflict

## The change in ad-hoc conversation and the impact on team communication and knowledge sharing
- Less spontanious social interactions (informal information exchange)
- conversations are more purpose driven
  - increases efficiancy 
  - more tasks are completed
  - you need a topic to call
  - less disruptions
- less sponatnious meetings makes it harder to coordinate and knowledge sharing
  - less shoulder taps
  - cannot distinguish between busy and not busy
  - sending too many messages makes things akward

Learning and knowledgeshareing is important for the teams success. But the new enviroment create barriers for learning and problem solving.

## Virtual meetins as a double-edged sword for team collaboration
pros:
- regular formal meetings
- improved communication
- more thoughtful communication of topics
- established morning routines
- more agile allocation of tasks

cons:
- virtual meeting fatigue
  - when clashing with private schedule
- now the need to schedule meetings to communicate
- isolation and no personal contact for one group
- no quiet enviroment and surrounded by people for the other
  - children are at home aswell
  - not everybody has his own home office

## Socialising and networking through virtual channels
No more company gatherings and going to bars
- more international communication and networking
- new connections independent of business structures
- more equal integration of all workers
- one big group discussion instead of many small groups
- more involvement of social media / more personal
- less urgency

# Discussion and conclusion
Before Covid: Technological Affordance was mostly supportive
- finishing tasks
- connecting to remote workers

Enviromental Affordance was main facilitator. During covid the affordance shifted. Less enviromental affordance and more technological affordance.

more opportunities for homeworkers as well as between team members and leaders for communication. Less isolation for home workers.

Communication styles had to be adjusted to be technological only. You cannot just ask your colleague something quick during the meeting.
- No simultanious talking
- no mingeling from group to group
- checkin meetings are too often
  
Affordance enviroment and technology are pre covid complementary, now conflicting.
- home needs to be compromised for work
- home enviroment tanks productivity
- does not support social interaction
- no physical activities
- shared with other people
- dynamic schedules/ more autonomy
