# Viritually in this together - Hacker et al

## Introduction

- Web conferencing systems (WCS) like Zoom or Teams were there pre Covid
- still issues with hearing due to internet connection
- Lives where disrupted by pandemic
- Covid lead to a **quick** switch to virtual systems
- then, these systems were also adapted to private life (eg social clubs)
- emerged to standart commnunication channel

## Web conferencing systems

- aim: faciliate virtual meetings among participants over internet
- support audio and video calls
- usable for distance learning
- keep in touch with family
- physical distance is still perceived as barrier (death of distance)
- new features due to changed affordances (raise hand feature)
- **In this paper**: Clarify the role by drawing on affordance theory

## Affordance theory

- Affordance = Aufforderungscharacter, Erleichterung?
- actors perceive objects not by their material properties, but depending on their affordance -> to meet their goals
- achiving a perceived outcome
- refers to enablement
- eg receiving mails on smartphone enables to act from various locations
- affordance lense here is used to see the perspective/context of lockdown
- how people used WCS to interact in the pandemic

## Research Method

- Study goal: document use of WCS in time
- data driven apporach

## Data collection and preparation

- source: Twitter
- offers deep analysis
- use twitters REST-API
- search terms: microsoftteams, skype, zoom, webex
-12 weeks of data collection --> hard to tell the shift in time??
- only english tweets
- filtered out duplicates (many, 95%)

## Data analysis

- text mining apporach (MineMyText)
- score model for each nubers
- 4 pre-processing steps
	1. Removing username, url, numbers, punctuations
	2. splitting tweets into single words and sequences of two words
	3. removing stopwiords (the, is, and)
	4. reducing words to their dictionalry form
- labled context by *business. private live, education*
- excluding topics, eg zoom in context with cameras
