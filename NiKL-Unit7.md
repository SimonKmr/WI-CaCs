# Viritually in this together - Hacker et al

## Introduction

- Web conferencing systems (WCS) like Zoom or Teams were there pre Covid
- still issues with hearing due to internet connection
- Lives where disrupted by pandemic
- Covid lead to a **quick** switch to virtual systems
- then, these systems were also adapted to private life (eg social clubs)
- emerged to standart commnunication channel

## Web conferencing systems

- aim: faciliate virtual meetings among participants over internet
- support audio and video calls
- usable for distance learning
- keep in touch with family
- physical distance is still perceived as barrier (death of distance)
- new features due to changed affordances (raise hand feature)
- **In this paper**: Clarify the role by drawing on affordance theory

## Affordance theory

- Affordance = Aufforderungscharacter, Erleichterung?
- actors perceive objects not by their material properties, but depending on their affordance -> to meet their goals
- achiving a perceived outcome
- refers to enablement
- eg receiving mails on smartphone enables to act from various locations
- affordance lense here is used to see the perspective/context of lockdown
- how people used WCS to interact in the pandemic

## Research Method

- Study goal: document use of WCS in time
- data driven apporach

## Data collection and preparation

- source: Twitter
- offers deep analysis
- use twitters REST-API
- search terms: microsoftteams, skype, zoom, webex
-12 weeks of data collection --> hard to tell the shift in time??
- only english tweets
- filtered out duplicates (many, 95%)

## Data analysis

- text mining apporach (MineMyText)
- score model for each nubers
- 4 pre-processing steps
	1. Removing username, url, numbers, punctuations
	2. splitting tweets into single words and sequences of two words
	3. removing stopwiords (the, is, and)
	4. reducing words to their dictionalry form
- labled context by *business. private live, education*
- excluding topics, eg zoom in context with cameras

##Findings

### Affordances

- 5 found
- depend on various parts of individuals' lives

1. Communicating with social groups
(catch ups or coffee brakees)
- keep in touch with people
- meet and socialize online
- meet with groups (you knew before) such as clubs
- sense of togherness


2. Engaging in shared social actities with families and friends
- reason for having the time to talk -> evening activities suspended
- viritualize social interactions that did not have taken place otherwise
- 

3. Attending events
(viritual concerts, church, board meetings)
- takes place online, which normally would be non-viritual
- 

4. Pursuing hobbies
- interactive activities
- study does not analyze, who took part in these classes (and why)
- viritual substitute for physical hobby, which is difficult to digitalize

5. Comsuming not-recrancrantional services
webinars
- consulting virtual, also appointments
- career advice

## Constraints

- issues with tech 
- technology and lockdown-related

1. Lacking features and competencies
- setting up and getting started

2. Having fear of beeing on camera
- difficult to comply with norms and habits
- wearing clothes while beeing at work -> people wear sleeping wear, don't wash hair, as long as they do not expect to be on a company call
- reluctant to use the camera

3. Always be on /Zoom Fatigue
- spending much more time in meetings
- problem of beeing isolated at home -> viritual social meetings against it
- people then tend to limit number of video calls, try to maintain mental health

4. Exposing private living space
- new co-workers - family
- akward situations at meetings
- soultion: viritual backgrounds

5. Lacking security - vulnerabiltiy
- zoombombing
- online trolling
- peaking into peoples private life

## Discussion and directions for future research

- disruptive events can lead opeople to reasess existing social norms and order
- crisis can trigger emerge of new technologies (eg also bitcoin after financial crisis)
- **speed of adaption to WCS was unique**
- previously, these technologies were known, but not seen as necessary
- **WCS had a collective process of learning**
- used also in private live, not only companies
- **discourse, of which new established virtual practicies should stay**
- new business models?
- hybrid becoming more important?
- new travel politics? is it really important to travel?
- **WCS emerged to a standart communication channl pertaining multiple areas of life**
- **WCS faciliated shared and synchronous social activities that apporximate real life interactions**
- **improvement needed to make encouters more natural**
- physical coffee machine helps to get into smalltalk -> does not work online
- need for research: viritual togetherness vs presence
- **WCS facilitated activities and meet­ings that would not have taken place otherwise.**
- easy to organize meetings with people (old friends) that live far away
- **digital inclusion of less digital fit groups**
- **unique blending of contexts**
- -> now blurring - private vs work
- new features to make **good impressions**
- to some people, virtual meetings are better than nothing
- online meetings are not sufficient for people to feel like beeing somewhere else
- sometimes leads to physical and mental exhaustion 
- cyber attacks: **The more you commnuicate online- the more you are vulnerable
- need for privacy- and security-enhancing features
- need for employee training how to avoid issues
-

## Conclusion, limitations and outlook

- analysis suggested that WCS emerge
- temporary locked down due to corona
- crisis stimulated people's creativity
- benefits and constraints were discussed
- discussed limitations
- identified affordances
- spam, inflated amount of information and text-
- global community found new ways of changing


----
Personal notes:
online, it is hard to get to know new people - other that talking smalltalk at the coffee shop you visit every day

Working on projects online in our experience does not foster a team spirit. Do you think that that group works are as productive as face-to-face - or even better or worse?


In an interview with a HR manger of Telekom, I heard that they were able to register a lower amount of illness during lockdown because noone infected themselves with "normal" illnesses(since most people were only at home). Due to that, they also registered a better productivity. Do you think, that a that the new ways of communication do have a positive macroeconomic advantage?
