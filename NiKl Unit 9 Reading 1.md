2) distributed groups- resident at respective different universities
3) mixed groups - different groups at different universities

Decision making profile information was used for decision making
then exchange arguements within discussion


Media and Distribution Effects

- short term viritual groups ofteen fail to ddevelop eeffective interpersonal relations
- long term, effect is reduced
- geographic locations divide group into subgroups
- identification more with local team, there less conflicts, more trust than distant team
- problem: remote partner might be ignored

Group disagreement and Minority Influence

- considering minorities opinion 
 -OR
- minimize potential of minority influence (eg discount deviant opinion) - die abweichende meinung verwerfen

- Minority influence can lead to that people reaxamine the enitre situation
- Changes in majority opinion can happen in private or public
- opinion divergence increases unvertainty, esp if it arises from perceived similar people
- uncertainty is created by individual awareness

Double Minority

= how group members with different opinion is disregarded if he is seen different from others in an additional important respect
- indicivual = double minority -> cognitive salient (hervorhebender) factor explains deviant position
?????

Congruence

- It is expected, that similar people have similar opinions - analogue for people which are perceived different
- group members should be influenced more by divergent opinions and from dissimilar others but less attentive to divergent information from similar people

- Experiment showed that important information hold by non-familiar member is seen more  - problem solved more effectively


Black Sheep Effect

 = in group members, which are deviant, are rejected more strongly than outgroup members
- seen from majority as having a negative influence, active rejection

Minority Leniency Contract

- alternative persepective with respect to minority opinion
= out group members are ignored with their contrary opinion
- in group members with minority opinion are reclassified as out group members (as traitor)

In General:
- different effects are triggered depending on situation:
	- minority leniacy contract: Greater influence of minority opinion, when this opinion was isolated
	- ??? When does it differ to trigger the black sheep effect
	

Experiment:

- group of participants of a location - each one knew where who comes from (attached to nake)
- asyncrounous discussion board
- 


Q: What can be done to overcome the problem of dividing groups by their place and how can trust be build among the whole team?

Q: The effects shown in the text are not rational in decision finding. How can one overcome these effects so that a neutral discussion about opinions can happen?
