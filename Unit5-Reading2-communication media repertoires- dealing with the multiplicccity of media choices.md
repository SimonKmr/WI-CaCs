# Introduction

- Organizations rely on information tech to support flexibility in processes
- enables coworking while being separated in groups and various locations
- Technologies for coworking increase, starting with mobile phones and instant messaging -> now multiple media environments

**In this research:**
- how workers use the combinations of communication media
- simultaneous or sequential use
- studying media choice in this paper
- communication media = collection of communication channels and identifiable
routines of use for specific communication purposes within a
defined community

- Takes place in two fortune 100 companies
- Identify patterns of media choice
- propose framework
- understand the habits/usage of different communication media for different purposes

# Background

- Information- and Communication technologies (ICT) integrated for organizational work

## Previous Research

- media trait theories
	- media choice assumed to be rational **is it?**
	- same medium can be rich or lean, depending on situation
	- individuals experience with media influences perceived richness of of a medium - changes over time
- contextual factors
	- significant influence by it's characteristics of decision making (importance, urgency)
	- understanding of contextual factors is socially constructed

- social actor
	- physical and material characteristics of different
media are combined with the social and institutional context
of the user to influence the construction of meaning and
therefore the use of specific media

## Summary of Previous Research

- different perception of media usage depending on circumstances
- influence of communication nomrs for work within groups


## Multipe Media Usage

- Goal: investigate, which and what media is used in which setting
- Genre repertoire: 
	- employees develop understanding when and what media is used in which occasion
	- richer understanding of media usage
- socially established normes


## Company MyCo

- Two functional areas: sales and tech
- Tech divided by:
	1. technical specialist
	2. consultant
- Sales:
	- responsible for identifing, crating, cultivating new service opportunities
- Account representativs identify need for particular solution
- Technical specialist: Educatong other employees
- Consultant: Primarily concerned with products and post sales
- Office free environment, workspaces, but not personalized officies
- Encouraged to spend more time at customer side


## Company IntOrg

- dedicated to one large customer
- division is responsible for product performance and maintaining

- 4 functional areas:
1. service managers
	- responisble for reacting to customers concerns and emergencies
2. product specialists
	- identify new opportunites for their products
	- also other customers
	- 
3. client managers
 	- work very closely to servce managers on technological issues
 	- identify opportunities
4. off site services
	- excecute services that have been outsourced
	- all over the country located all over the country

- IntOrg workers work from home

## Data Collection

- semi structured interviews
- interview participants: Managers and professionals in the division
	- taped
	- only name, job title and no other personal information
	- 50 minutes each
- publically available financial, size, and industry data etc
- observed physical work environment

## Results

- both similar size
- 20% of employees interviewed
- unit team members often had similar jobs
- often one team member joined remotely

## Physical Layouts

- Myco: cubicle farm, often empty due to home office and work at clients
	- 2.8 days/week remote work
	- most people do not have work remotely
- IntOrg: cube farm, but more traditional with high walled cubicles
	- many conference rooms
	- 0.6 d/w remote work
	
## communication media usage

- wide variety of technogogies used
- MyCo: 87 mails/day
	- 2-4 hrs respond time
	- 46% of employees say: Mails are work and information overload
	- no face to face meetings
- IntOrg: 51 mails/day
	- 24 hrs respond time
	- 29% mails are work and information overload

## Coordination 

- = process through which independence of tasks among individuals managed
- necessary for efficient cowork
- Myco: email as coordination medium, then face to face or phone
	- use meetings only for comlex tasks, often instead email or phone
	- 
- IntOrg: Chat or pagers
	- in conferences, often multitasking
	- get other things done in meetings
	- sometimes after confusion about what was told in the conferences
	- informal meetings, learn from others
 - Both opportunity tracking software

## Information Gathering

- preferred strategy at both: Personalization
- person to person contact, cloesly tied individualization
- MyCo:
	- ask for information in mails
	- first coworker, then manager
	
- IntOrg:
	- talk, ensure that coworkers have heard what to say
	- then take up information for further meetings

- other strategy: Codification
	- acessing information through electronic devices/resources
	- searching companies intranet

- MyCo:
	- difficult to find specialized information
	- ask specialist frist
	
(nothing for IntOrg)

## Relationship development

- = socializing with individuals and create individual networks
- informal relationships important for effective communication
- through theeir networks they get assigned to projects
- both prefer to use face to face for developing relationships
- Intorg:biggest challengee is to know team members
- Myco: since more geographically dispersed -> email is nnot sufficient to build relationships
- Conflict resolution: f2f can be confrontal, emails - you can hide behind them
-

## Discussion: Shaping Hypotheses

### Influencce of Institutional Factors

- social structure
- interpersonal trust

### Physicall Structure of Workspace

- IntOrg: Expected to work at side for the customer
- usage of many communication media
- 

- MyCo:
	- no assigned offices, work more from home
	- meetings scheduled ahead of time, sometimes ad hoc
	- good for knowledge sharing

### Interpersonal Trust

- levels of trust influence behaviour and usage of media
- interpersonal trust: extend of confidence to another (shortend)
- individuals do not choose one communication and one media -> not every time each medium is suitable
- problem: redundance
- level low: less confidents in promisies or other statements from collegues

Organizational Communication Media
- email is not sufficient, but easier to keep all informed and everyone receives every information (people forget, what is said in meetings)
- different aims lead to conflicts (cost or profit oriented)


### Framework for Investigating Communication media repositories

- further investigation in media reportoires 
- influence is not determistic
- two components: istitutional and stuational conditions
- depending on urgent or not (individual perception)
- expectations grow in a users group
- asynchronus media -> veryfication at intorg, not at myco


### Implications

- institutional factors influence media choice
- chat leads to different usage of media
- interrelations between media and preferences of choice
- companies could use protocols what media to use to educe uncertainties


### Conclusion

- need to develop and navigate different media usage
- increasing number of communication media
- comparing digital with face to face often insufficient
