# Introduction

- Organizations rely on information tech to supporr flexibility in processes
- enables coworking while being separated in groups and various locations
- Technologies for coworking increase, starting with mobile phones and instant messaging -> now multiple media environments

**In this research:**
- how workers use the combinations of communication media
- simultaneous or sequential use
- studying media choice in this paper
- communication media = collection of communication channels and identifiable
routines of use for specific communication purposes within a
defined community

- Takes place in two fortune 100 companies
- Identify patterns of media choice
- propose framework
- understand the habits/usage of different communication media for different purposes

# Background

- Information- and Communication technologies (ICT) integrated for organizational work

##Previous Research

- media trait theories
	- media choice assumed to be rational **is it?**
	- same medium can be rich or lean, depending on situation
	- individuals experience with media influences perceived richness of of a medium - changes over time
- contextual factors
	- significant influence by it's characteristics of decision making (importance, urgency)
	- understanding of contextual factors is socially constructed

- social actor
	- physical and material characteristics of different
media are combined with the social and institutional context
of the user to influence the construction of meaning and
therefore the use of specific media

## Summary of Previous Research

## Data COllection

- semi structured interviews
- interview participants: Managers and professionals in the division
	- taped
	- only name, job title and no other personal information
	- 50 minutes each
- publically available financial, size, and industry data etc
- observed physical work environment

## Results

- both similar size
- 20% of employees interviewed
- unit team members often had similar jobs
- often one team member joined remotely
- 

## Physical Layouts

- Myco: cubicle farm, often empty due to home office and work at clients
	- 2.8 days/week remote work
	- most people do not have work remotely
- IntOrg: cube farm, but more traditional with high walled cubicles
	- many conference rooms
	- 0.6 d/w remote work
	
## communication media usage

- wide variety of technogogies used
- MyCo: 87 mails/day
	- 2-4 hrs respond time
	- 46% of employees say: Mails are work and information overload
	- no face to face meetings
- IntOrg: 51 mails/day
	- 24 hrs respond time
	- 29% mails are work and information overload

## Coordination 

- = process through which independence of tasks among individuals managed
- necessary for efficient cowork
- Myco: email as coordination medium, then face to face or phone
	- use meetings only for comlex tasks, often instead email or phone
	- 
- IntOrg: Chat or pagers
	- in conferences, often multitasking
	- get other things done in meetings
	- sometimes after confusion about what was told in the conferences
	- informal meetings, learn from others
 - Both opportunity tracking software

## Information Gathering

- preferred strategy at both: Personalization
- person to person contact, cloesly tied individualization
- MyCo:
	- ask for information in mails
	- first coworker, then manager
	
- IntOrg:
	- talk, ensure that coworkers have heard what to say
	- then take up information for further meetings

- other strategy: Codification
	- acessing information through electronic devices/resources
	- searching companies intranet

- MyCo:
	- difficult to find specialized information
	- ask specialist frist
	
(nothing for IntOrg)

## Relationship development

- = socializing with individuals and create individual networks
- informal relationships important for effective communication
- through theeir networks they get assigned to projects
- both prefer to use face to face for developing relationships
- Intorg:biggest challengee is to know team members
- Myco: since more geographically dispersed -> email is nnot sufficient to build relationships
- Conflict resolution: f2f can be confrontal, emails - you can hide behind them
-
